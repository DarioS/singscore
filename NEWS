CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.1 (2019-10-03)
-------------------------------------

  o added link to the F1000research published workflow that demonstrates usage of singscore on a real dataset (https://f1000research.com/articles/8-776/v2)
  o allow labelling of samples on dispersion plots (`plotDispersion`) in a similar manner to landscape plots (`projectScoreLandscape`)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2
------------------------

  o allow continous and discrete annotations for `plotDispersion` and `projectScoreLandscape`. Annotations can now be part of the score data.frame and then specified as a column name
  o plot themes updated
  o citation updated: cite the singscore manuscript
  o number of bins for the hexbin plot in `plotLandscape` is determined from the data
  o fixed bug in calculation of scores. Boundary calculation was previously done with all genes in the gene-set. It should be done with genes present in both the gene-set and the data (i.e. after filtering out those not measured in the data).
  o TotalDispersion now estimated as the mean of dispersions from the up- and down-regulated gene sets instead of the sum (previous estimate divided by 2)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.2
------------------------

  o created a website for the package
  o added ORCID IDs for authors
  o added sticker for package

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.9

  o vectorize getPvals
  o make toy_epxr_se

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.5
-------------------------

  o represent expression data in SummarizedExperiement dataset
  o function input checkings
  o R code re-organised

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.3
-------------------------

  o change argument name bidirectional to knownDirection, default as TRUE

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.2
-------------------------

  o bidirection flag added to simpleScore() function
  o optimise generateNull() function
  o change GSEABase from import to Depends
